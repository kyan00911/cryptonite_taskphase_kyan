# Intro to Commands

In this challenge I connected my ssh key to the server and used my first command 'hello' as directed which gave the necessary flag
``` bash
kyanagarwal@Kyans-MacBook-Air ~ % ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{83aECLXvB_uJDd1Mee48EZZfdvw.ddjNyUDL1gDN1czW}
```

# Intro to Arguments

This challenge was straightforward too, along with the hello command I used an argument called hackers which gave the flag
``` bash
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{46dsmKieXl3ikaSr75Rs7JXuxCz.dhjNyUDL1gDN1czW}
```
